# WanPy

This package is an extension for the `pythtb` Python package that adds functionality to construct maximally localized Wannier functions. 

Classes and modules to work with `pythtb` tight-binding models can be found in [WanPy/wpythtb.py](/WanPy/wpythtb.py). A standalone module is in progress that will provide the same functionality starting from a `numpy` array of Bloch eigenstates on a k-mesh, found in [WanPy/wanpy.py](/WanPy/wanpy.py)
